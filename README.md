# blackjack-WPF-project
This is a project from one of my programming courses in college. It consists of parsing web API to create a game of blackjack. It is done using a WPF that I created in visual studios. The card images and values are pulled from the API while all of the conditions and functions are written in C#. These conditions are not perfect and could use work. My main focus point was to demonstrate the processing of data. Please forgive me for the partial incompleteness as I developed this entire project in less than a day. To see the main page of coding click on the image_trial folder ---> MainWindow.xaml.cs. There is also a folder in there listed as class1 containing a seperate class of code. You may also download the image_trial.exe application to actually use this project although your computer may not like it because it is an unrecognized application with no licensing. For a further overview on my game please check the link to my website.
