# blackjack-MVC-project
This is a project from one of my programming courses in college. It consists of parsing web API to create a game of blackjack. It is done using an MVC that I created on visual studios. The card images and values are pulled from the API while all of the conditions and functions are written in C#. For a further overview on my game please check the link to my website.
